  - Add `useCallback` for event handlers
  - Use `useMemo` for expensive computations
  - Optimize re-renders
- **Value**:
  - Better performance
  - Reduced unnecessary re-renders
  - Improved app responsiveness
  - Better resource utilization

## Animation Logic

### 6. ArticleSwipeScreen.tsx Animations
- **Current State**: Complex animation logic mixed with component logic
- **Required Changes**:
  - Extract animation logic to custom hooks
  - Separate animation concerns
  - Create reusable animation utilities
- **Value**:
  - Better code organization
  - Reusable animation logic
  - Easier maintenance
  - Improved performance

## Constants Management

### 7. Configuration
- **Current State**: Hardcoded constants throughout the codebase
- **Required Changes**:
  - Create centralized constants file
  - Move configuration to theme
  - Implement proper configuration management
- **Value**:
  - Centralized configuration
  - Easier updates
  - Better maintainability
  - Consistent values across the app

## Component Props

### 8. Props Management
- **Current State**: Inconsistent prop types and optional props
- **Required Changes**:
  - Add proper prop types
  - Standardize optional props
  - Improve component documentation
- **Value**:
  - Better type safety
  - Improved component documentation
  - Easier component usage
  - Reduced bugs

## Accessibility

### 9. Accessibility Support
- **Current State**: Missing accessibility features
- **Required Changes**:
  - Add accessibility props
  - Implement proper labels
  - Add screen reader support
  - Improve navigation accessibility
- **Value**:
  - Better accessibility support
  - Improved user experience
  - Compliance with accessibility standards
  - Broader user base support

## Implementation Priority

1. Type Safety (High Priority)
   - Critical for preventing runtime errors
   - Foundation for other improvements

2. Error Handling (High Priority)
   - Essential for user experience
   - Critical for app stability

3. Performance Optimization (Medium Priority)
   - Important for user experience
   - Can be implemented incrementally

4. Styling Issues (Medium Priority)
   - Important for consistency
   - Can be implemented gradually

5. Component Structure (Medium Priority)
   - Important for maintainability
   - Can be refactored incrementally

6. Animation Logic (Low Priority)
   - Can be improved after core functionality
   - Less critical for basic functionality

7. Constants Management (Low Priority)
   - Can be implemented as needed
   - Less critical for immediate functionality

8. Props Management (Low Priority)
   - Can be improved gradually
   - Less critical for immediate functionality

9. Accessibility (Low Priority)
   - Can be implemented incrementally
   - Less critical for immediate functionality
